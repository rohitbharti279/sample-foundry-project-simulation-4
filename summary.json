{"name": "Smart Contract Project Analysis", "summary": "This project appears to consist of two smart contracts: `MyToken.sol` and `Counter.sol`.  Based on the names, `MyToken.sol` likely implements a basic ERC-20 token with standard functionalities such as minting, transferring, and burning tokens. `Counter.sol` is probably a simple contract that implements a counter with increment and decrement functions, used for demonstrating basic smart contract functionality or tracking on-chain events.", "type": "smart contract project analysis", "dev_tool": "foundry", "contracts": [{"name": "MyToken", "path": "/tmp/workspaces/s4/sample-foundry-project/src/MyToken.sol", "type": "contract", "summary": "This contract implements a basic ERC20 token ('MyToken') with symbol 'MTK', minting an initial supply to the deployer.", "functions": [], "is_deployable": true, "constructor": "constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\") {\n        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);\n    }"}, {"name": "Counter", "path": "/tmp/workspaces/s4/sample-foundry-project/src/Counter.sol", "type": "contract", "summary": "This contract implements a simple counter that can be incremented and set to a specific number.", "functions": [{"name": "setNumber", "summary": "Sets the counter to a new number.", "inputs": ["uint256 newNumber"], "outputs": []}, {"name": "increment", "summary": "Increments the counter.", "inputs": [], "outputs": []}], "is_deployable": true, "constructor": "null"}]}
